## What I Liked
I liked that projects are defined at the right level of abstraction meaning that they are concrete enough that the teams know what to do but abstract enough that they there is room for creativity and working out the details themselves at the implementation stage. 

Another benefit of having some level of abstraction in the project is that it may prevent estimation errors in terms of the time that the project might take to complete. This is the case because if the project is too concrete, it may contain hidden complexities which were not estimated for during the design process but are only discovered in the implementation process as the developer is restricted to the concrete design of the project. In contrast, if the project was a little more abstract, the developer could better weigh design and implementation costs as it relates to the value that component might provide to the client or the overall project.

## What I Disliked
I disliked the points mentioned about "Good" being relative. This is because if the project manager and the team has decided for a project to be in a certain state to be considered "good" or complete. This decision has already taken into account the developmental effort that is required by the developer to achieve this state or the level of "good". So the state of "good" should be predefined and agreed upon by the team and therefore this state should not be relative and somewhat concrete.

## Open Ended Questions
What is the reasoning for having some of level of abstraction and some level of concreteness? Why not select an approach based on the experience of the developer (i.e entry level developer compared to an experienced developer)?

How would the "Fixed Time, Variable Scope" principle work for a project where the scope and has been established for the most part to be concrete? Would the fixed time no longer be a constraint?

Why is shaping only done with a few individuals of the team and why can it not be done with the entire team much like sprint grooming which is usually done with most or all team members?
